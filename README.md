# California's Fentanyl Problem

California has experienced an unprecedented climb in overdose deaths over the past four years, primarily contributed to the opioid Fentanyl. This GitHub repository analyzes the State's data related to these deaths combined with data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Please visit the Tableau dashboard listed below to interact with the data. Below is an overview of my process to repeat this analysis for future data releases and all py scripts are embedded with comments. Furthermore, I provide my findings in the data with some reccomendations for the State to ensure support and enforcement mechanisms are focused proportionately in the appropriate counties.

<b> Overdose Definition:</b> 
Drug overdose deaths caused by acute poisonings that involve fentanyl or fentanyl analogs as a contributing cause of death, regardless of intent (e.g., unintentional, suicide, assault, or undetermined). Fentanyl and associated analogs are strong synthetic opioid analgesics that may be prescribed or obtained illegally. Deaths related to chronic use of drugs (e.g., damage to organs from long-term drug use), are excluded from this indicator.
